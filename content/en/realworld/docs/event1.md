## Event
**Situation**: Users are calling in to say the application is running slow

## Discussion
See if you can find out what is going on in the system that is causing the issue.

### Questions to consider
* Do we have all of the information we need to troubleshoot the issue?
* Is this information be alertable? Is alerting on this data the best way to deal with the problem?
* The users contacted us. How else could we find out about application slowness before a user calls us?
* How much time did it take before we found out about this issue? What could be the cost of those delays?

**STOP**: Don't move past here until you have discussed the situation.
