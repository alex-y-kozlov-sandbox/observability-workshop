## Spring PetClinic Application

{{% alert title="Prerequisites" %}}
Splunk run workshop where instance is provided  **OR**
Self led workshop on own system  / [multipass instance](https://github.com/signalfx/observability-workshop/tree/master/multipass)

For own system you will need the following on your machine:

1. Java installed
2. Port 8080 open inbound/outbound
{{% /alert %}}

First thing we need to setup APM is... well, an application. For this exercise, we will use the Spring Pet Clinic application. This is a very popular sample java application built with Spring framework (Springboot).

Next we will clone the PetClinic repository, then we will compile, build, package and test the application.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic
```

Change into the `spring-petclinic` directory:

```bash
cd spring-petclinic
```

Start a MySQL database for Pet Clinic to use:

```bash
docker run -d -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```

Next, run the maven command to compile/build/package Pet Clinic:

```bash
./mvnw package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

{{% alert title="Information" %}}
This will take a few minutes the first time you run, maven will download a lot of dependencies before it actually compiles the app. Future executions will be a lot shorter.
{{% /alert %}}

Once the compilation is complete, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
java -jar target/spring-petclinic-*.jar --spring.profiles.active=mysql
```

You can validate if the application is running by visiting `http://<VM_IP_ADDRESS>:8080`.

**Once your validation is complete you need to stop the application by pressing** `Ctrl-c` **so that we can auto-instrument the application with Splunk OpenTelemetry.**

## Auto-Instrument with Splunk OpenTelemetry

Now that the application is running, it is time to setup the APM instrumentation. The Splunk APM product uses OpenTelemetry libraries to instrument the applications [https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-java](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-java).
The Otel-Java library will instrument code to generate metrics and spans/traces that are reported to the OpenTelemetry Collector we installed previously.

Let's continue the process by visiting the Splunk Observability Cloud UI again **Hamburguer Menu → Data Setup** then **Monitor applications → Java (Provide Traces) → Add Intergration**.

The APM Instrumentation Wizard will show a few options for you to select, things like service name, environment, etc. In this scenario we are using:

- Service Name: `<hostname>-petclinic-service`
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:4317`
- Environment: `<hostname>-petclinic-env`
- AlwaysOn Profiling: `Yes`
- Collect Metrics: `Yes`
- Kubernetes: `No`
- Legacy Agent: `No`

At the end of the wizard, you'll be given a set of commands to run (similar to the Splunk IM instructions) **make sure you are in the spring-petclinic directory!**

Download the latest version of the Splunk Open Telemetry Java Instrumentation library:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-java/releases/latest/download/splunk-otel-javaagent-all.jar -o splunk-otel-javaagent.jar
```

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=$(hostname)-petclinic-service
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=deployment.environment=$(hostname)-petclinic-env,version=0.314
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT='http://localhost:4317'
```

Lastly, we will run our application adding the -javaagent tag in front of the command

```bash
java -javaagent:./splunk-otel-javaagent.jar \
-Dsplunk.profiler.enabled=true \
-Dsplunk.metrics.enabled=true \
-jar target/spring-petclinic-*-SNAPSHOT.jar \
--spring.profiles.active=mysql
```

Let's go visit our application again to generate some traffic `http://<VM_IP_ADDRESS>:8080`. Click around, generate errors, add visits, etc. Then you can visit the Splunk APM UI and examine the application components, traces, etc. **Hamburguer Menu → APM → Explore**.
