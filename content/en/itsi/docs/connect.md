<!-- ## Login to your Splunk Instance -->

We deeply believe that the best way for you to familiarize yourself with the Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) Add-On is to get your hands dirty. Therefore, we provide individual sandbox environments in the form of Splunk instances for you. The first task of this workshop for you is to connect to UI for those instances.

**A successful connection to your instance can be established via executing the following steps:**

Access the Instance List by clicking [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hc8tPm1xNGq_KkoPlV6BTmJbG0DJQWto_Jb1jAoKuOI/edit?usp=sharing).
You should be able to see a Google spreadsheet that looks similar to the example below:

<!-- ![Access Sheet](../../images/access_aws_instance/access_sheet.png) -->
<img src="../../images/access_aws_instance/access_sheet.png" alt="Access Sheet" style="width: 65%;"/>

In the first column with the title *Name of Attendee* locate your name. **Find your personal access link to the instance on the right of your name** and use it to reach the login page of Splunk Enterprise. It should look like this:

![Login](../../images/access_aws_instance/login.png)

To log in, use the username **admin**, and the password that is provided for you in the [Instance List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hc8tPm1xNGq_KkoPlV6BTmJbG0DJQWto_Jb1jAoKuOI/edit?usp=sharing). Click the *Sign In*-Button.

On a successful login, you might get greeted by pop-up windows showing tips, tutorials, and/or recommendations. These are not important for us right now. Feel free to ignore them by clicking the **Got it!** button and the **Don't show me this again** button. Other than that, you should be able now to see Splunk Enterprise Home view, which initially looks like this:

![Home View](../../images/access_aws_instance/home_view.png)

If you fail to see this home view, most likely something went wrong. Please do not hesitate to raise your hand in Zoom, or shoot us a short message in the Zoom channel. An assistant will be with you shortly.

You have now successfully connected to your instance, and thus completed the first task!
